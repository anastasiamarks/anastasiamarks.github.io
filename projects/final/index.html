  <p>Graduate school enrollment is on the decline at the University of Maryland, despite postbaccalaureate student rates trending upwards nationally.</p><p>The most recent data from the University’s Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment department, which keeps counts of enrollment in every department and tracks their trends, shows that the University of Maryland in College Park’s graduate school has been on a slow but steady decline since 2011. Only 9,834 graduate students are attending College Park as of October, an almost 4% decrease from last fall and a 9% decrease since Fall 2011. </p>
